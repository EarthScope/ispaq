3.0.0
 * ports code to Python3
 * includes MUSTANG metrics sample_rate_resp, sample_rate_channel, max_range
 * modifications to preference file default.txt
 * access to IRIS PH5 archive data, using IRISPH5 name
 * includes option to write metric values to SQLite database
 * updates recommended conda package versions
 * requires installation of R-packages seismicRoll 1.1.4, IRISMustangMetrics 2.4.4, IRISSeismic 1.6.3
 * metric transfer_function will run on all requested days
 * local data will be marked percent_availability=0 for target-days without data if metadata is included for target. 

2.0.1
 * updates recommended conda ObsPy package version to 1.1.1. Run `run_ispaq.py -U` to install ObsPy 1.1.1.

2.0.0
 * adds aggregate PDF feature, in addition to the original daily PDF functionality. Aggregate PDFs
   calculate and display PDFs as a single text file or single plot for the entire time period between starttime
   and endtime.
 * dead_channel_exp has been retired and is no longer available as a metric.
 * 'pdf_plot' and 'pdf_text' are no longer metric name options. They have been replaced by metric name 'pdf'.
 * custom preference files from previous ISPAQ versions will need to be modified to replace 'pdf_plot' and 
   'pdf_text' with 'pdf', and to remove dead_channel_exp
 * significant changes made to format of preference files with the addition of PDF_Preferences:
   pdf_type specifies text or plot (or both), pdf_interval specifies daily or aggregated, and
   plot_include allows you to specify whether the PDF plot should display the legend, colorbar, or
   fixed_yaxis_limits of -25,-225 dB.
 * other preference file changes include: 'png_dir' has been removed as a Preferences option and replaced by
   'pdf_dir' to specify where to write PDF plot and text files. 'psd_dir' has been added to Preferences as a
   directory to store PSD text files (in csv format).
 * PSD text files are required to calculate PDFs and these can be created by running the metric 'psd_corrected'. They
   will be written to the directory specified as 'psd_dir' in the Preferences, with a directory structure of
   psd_dir/network/station. If the metric 'pdf' is run, it will look in the 'psd_dir' directory for PSD text files. To run
   both PSD and PDFs at the same time, use 'psd_corrected,pdf' either in the preference file or the command line.
 * command line options have been changed to match the changes to the preference files. These new options override the 
   preference files.
 * requires installation of R-package IRISMustangMetrics 2.2.0

   if it detects that you are using old versions

   conda environment instead of failing
