## INFORMATION ABOUT THE PREFERENCE FILE --------------------------------------

# Preferences fall into five categories:
#  * Metrics -- aliases for user defined combinations of metrics
#  * Station_SNCLs -- aliases for user defined combinations of SNCL patterns
#                     SNCL patterns are station names formatted as Network.Station.Location.Channel.[Quality], where 
#                     [ ] denotes an optional element.
#                     Wildcards * and ? are allowed (*.*.*.*). 
#                     SNCL pattern format can be modified using the Preferences sncl_format.
#	              NOTE: the use of the quality code is optional and is not fully utilized in this version of ISPAQ. Specifying 
#                           a quality code will not guarantee that ISPAQ retrieves data with only that quality code; instead data 
#                           will be of whatever quality the specified web services (or local data) provides. This is a known issue and 
#                           will be addressed in a future release. The pdf metric will use the quality code specified, if there is one, 
#                           as it retrieves PSDs. If no quality code is specified in the station SNCL, then it will look for any and all 
#                           quality codes that might exist for that SNCL.
#  * Data_Access -- FDSN web services or local files
#  * Preferences -- additional user preferences
#  * PDF_Preferences -- preferences specific to PDF calculation
#
# This file is in a very simple format.  After each category heading, all lines containing a colon 
# will be interpreted as key:value and made available to ISPAQ.
#
# Text to the right of `#` are comments and are ignored by the parser

# About the Data_Access Section:
# FDSN service providers may be specified by using one of the following names:
#
#   BGR, EMSC, ETH, GEONET, GFZ, INGV, IPGP, IRIS, ISC, KOERI,
#   LMU, NCEDC, NIEP, ODC, ORFEUS, RESIF, SCEDC, USGS, USP
#
#   FDSN service providers may also be specified as an http:// address:
#   example, http://service.iris.edu 
#
#   Specified FDSN service provider must be the same for dataselect_url and station_url
#   and you should not specify one as FDSN and the other as local
#
#   The FDSN event service must provide an option for text output.
#
# To access the IRIS PH5 archive, use the IRISPH5 name. This will direct ISPAQ to
# http://service.iris.edu/ph5ws for data and metadata.
# This must be the same for dataselect_url and station_url.
#
# To use local data you must instead specify local paths:
# 
#  * dataselect_url: directory containing miniseed files
#  * event_url: path of QUAKEML file (can also be FDSN service provider)
#  * station_url: path of StationXML file (can also be FDSN service provider)
#  * resp_dir: directory containing local response RESP files, if used.
#
# If resp_dir is left blank with no directory specified, ISPAQ defaults to the IRIS DMC evalresp web 
# service http://service.iris.edu/irisws/evalresp/1/
#
# NOTE: Directory names should not match FDSN provider names.


# About the PDF_Preferences section:
# This section is used only when the pdf metric is being calculated
# 	* pdf_type -- specifies the output format for the PDFs. These files will be written to the pdf_dir. There are two options:
#			- plot: png file
#			- text: a text file with a header with start/end information, followed by a list of freq,power,hits
#	* pdf_interval -- specifies the span of the PDF values calculated. There are two options:
#			- daily: calculate the PDF values for each day of the time range
#			- aggregated: calculate a single PDF for the entire time range, starting and ending at the specified times
#	* plot_include -- Where to specify plot options
#			- legend: includes a legend for min/max/mode
#			- colorbar: includes the colorbar on the right side of the plot
#			- fixed_yaxis_limits: sets the y-axis limits as -25 to -225 db
#				* normally the y-axis limits are determined by the data, but no smaller than
#				  the range of the NHNM and NLNM. The size of an individual frequency-power
#				  cell remains the same between plots, so the power range (y-axis) will 
#				  determine the height of the plot. This means that the aspect ratios of 
#				  the plots are naturally going to vary, depending on the data. 
#
# NOTE: 
#		* The PSD csv files to be used are to be found in the psd_dir specified in the "Preferences" section
#		* The pdf plots will be placed in in the pdf_dir specified in the "Preferences" section
# 		* BOTH the pdf_dir and the psd_dir are expected to have sub directories where the files are. If using
#		  ISPAQ to calculate the PSDs and PDFs, then this structure will be created automatically.
#		* The expected naming scheme:
#			pdf_dir/NETWORK/STATION/
#			psd_dir/NETWORK/STATION/
#
